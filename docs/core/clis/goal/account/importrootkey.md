## goal account importrootkey



Import .rootkey files from the data directory into a kmd wallet



### Synopsis



Import .rootkey files from the data directory into a kmd wallet. This is analogous to using the import command with an account seed mnemonic: the imported account will be displayed alongside your wallet-derived accounts, but will not be tied to your wallet mnemonic.
