## goal node catchup



Catchup the Algorand node to a specific catchpoint



### Synopsis



Catchup allows making large jumps over round ranges without the need to incrementally validate each individual round. Using external catchpoints is not a secure practice and should not be done for consensus participating nodes.

If no catchpoint is provided, this command attempts to lookup the latest catchpoint from algorand-catchpoints.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com.




```

goal node catchup [flags]


```



### Examples




```

goal node catchup 6500000#1234567890ABCDEF01234567890ABCDEF0	Start catching up to round 6500000 with the provided catchpoint

goal node catchup --abort					Abort the current catchup


```



### Options




```

  -x, --abort   Aborts the current catchup process

      --force   Forces fast catchup with implicit catchpoint to start without a consent prompt

  -h, --help    help for catchup


```



### Options inherited from parent commands




```

  -d, --datadir stringArray   Data directory for the node

  -k, --kmddir string         Data directory for kmd


```
