## goal clerk send



Send money to an address



### Synopsis



Send money from one account to another. Note: by default, the money will be withdrawn from the default account. Creates a transaction sending amount tokens from fromAddr to toAddr. If the optional --fee is not provided, the transaction will use the recommended amount. If the optional --firstvalid and --lastvalid are provided, the transaction will only be valid from round firstValid to round lastValid. If broadcast of the transaction is successful, the transaction ID will be returned.
